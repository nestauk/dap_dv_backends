"[[""The_Molecules"",90]]","Provided is an organism data processing method and device, storage medium and program that is able to predict and control changes in the state of an organism. The level of expression of molecules in an organism is measured over a set time interval; the measured time-series data is divided into a periodic component, an environmental stimulus response component and a baseline component; a constant region of the time-series data is identified from variations in the baseline component or from the amplitude or periodic variations of the periodic component; and causal relationships within the identified constant region are identified. The relationship between the external environment and variations in the internal environment is identified and from the causal relationships within the identified constant region, changes in the state of the organism are inferred. Further, from the relationship between the external environment and variations in the internal environment, inferring disease onset in the organism is possible. The molecules can be molecules in the blood or molecules in a culture medium."
"[[""Gene"",90]]","PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide an inspection report output apparatus which can output the information used as an indicator of a determination of a reexamination, when the reexamination is determined to be necessary in a gene chromosomal examination; an inspection report output method; an inspection report output program; and a gene chromosomal examination system.SOLUTION: An inspection report output apparatus (38A) which outputs the inspection report of a gene chromosomal examination which examines a chromosomal abnormality included in an embryo-derived cell comprises an information acquisition unit (104) which acquires information comprising an inspection result of the gene chromosomal examination; an inspection report production unit (108) which produces an inspection report, in which determination information of reexamination is given, used in the determination of reexamination; and an inspection report output unit (112) which outputs the produced inspection report.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 7"

It is critical to determine the most effective patient-specific treatment quickly. Exemplary embodiments use a data-driven approach to extracting brain tumor information from data obtain from Whole Slide Image that is uploaded through an interface. Exemplary embodiments generate the following information about a glioblastoma tumor from a brain biopsy slide using neural networks: annotated areas of relevant tissues, molecular subtype, and expression status of an important gene and include three steps: the segmentation of tumor features; prediction of molecular subtype; and prediction of gene methylation status from a WSI."
