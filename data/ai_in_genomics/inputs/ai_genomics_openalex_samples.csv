https://openalex.org/W4243629912,"In recent years, there's been a resurgence in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is gaining a lot of attention. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that can be used to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers with complex structures, or otherwise composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Estimation of depth in a Neural Network (NN) or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an integral as well as complicated process. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. This chapter describes the motivations for deep architecture, problem with large networks, the need for deep architecture and new implementation techniques for deep learning. At the end, there is also an algorithm to implement the deep architecture using the recursive nature of functions and transforming them to get the desired output."
https://openalex.org/W2808969514,"Abstract   Recombination hotspots in a genome are unevenly distributed. Hotspots are regions in a genome that show higher rates of meiotic recombinations. Computational methods for recombination hotspot prediction often use sophisticated features that are derived from physico-chemical or structure based properties of nucleotides. In this paper, we propose iRSpot-SF that uses sequence based features which are computationally cheap to generate. Four feature groups are used in our method: k-mer composition, gapped k-mer composition, TF-IDF of k-mers and reverse complement k-mer composition. We have used recursive feature elimination to select 17 top features for hotspot prediction. Our analysis shows the superiority of gapped k-mer composition and reverse complement k-mer composition features over others. We have used SVM with RBF kernel as a classification algorithm. We have tested our algorithm on standard benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods iRSpot-SF is able to produce significantly better results in terms of accuracy, Mathew's Correlation Coefficient and sensitivity which are 84.58%, 0.6941 and 84.57%. We have made our method readily available to use as a python based tool and made the datasets and source codes available at:  https://github.com/abdlmaruf/iRSpot-SF . An web application is developed based on iRSpot-SF and freely available to use at:  http://irspot.pythonanywhere.com/server.html ."
https://openalex.org/W3043425001,"Background: Whole-genome studies of vine cultivars have brought novel knowledge about the diversity, geographical relatedness, historical origin and dissemination, phenotype associations and genetic markers. Method: We applied SOM (self-organizing maps) portrayal, a neural network-based machine learning method, to re-analyze the genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data of nearly eight hundred grapevine cultivars. The method generates genome-specific data landscapes. Their topology reflects the geographical distribution of cultivars, indicates paths of cultivar dissemination in history and genome-phenotype associations about grape utilization. Results: The landscape of vine genomes resembles the geographic map of the Mediterranean world, reflecting two major dissemination paths from South Caucasus along a northern route via Balkan towards Western Europe and along a southern route via Palestine and Maghreb towards Iberian Peninsula. The Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as the Pyrenees, constitute barriers for genetic exchange. On the coarsest level of stratification, cultivars divide into three major groups: Western Europe and Italian grapes, Iberian grapes and vine cultivars from Near East and Maghreb regions. Genetic landmarks were associated with agronomic traits, referring to their utilization as table and wine grapes. Pseudotime analysis describes the dissemination of grapevines in an East to West direction in different waves of cultivation. Conclusion: In analogy to the tasks of the wine waiter in gastronomy, the sommelier, our ‘SOMmelier’-approach supports understanding the diversity of grapevine genomes in the context of their geographic and historical background, using SOM portrayal. It offers an option to supplement vine cultivar passports by genome fingerprint portraits."
https://openalex.org/W2482340213,"Radiomics has the potential to individualize patient treatment by using images that are already being routinely acquired. Defined as the extraction of quantitative imaging features from clinical images for use in statistical models, radiomics has had success in a variety of tumor sites and imaging modalities. Researchers new to the field must start by choosing software to segment tumors [or other regions of interest (ROI)], extract quantitative image features, and analyze the results. This review describes the various software programs available for these tasks and gives examples of the use of these programs in radiomics research."
https://openalex.org/W4200275335,"Neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are very heterogeneous in nature and typically diagnosed using self-reported symptoms. This makes it difficult to pose a confident prediction on the cases and does not provide insight into the underlying neural and biological mechanisms of these disorders. Combining neuroimaging and genomic data with a multi-modal 'predictome' paves the way for biologically informed markers and may improve prediction reliability. With that, we develop a multi-modal deep learning framework by fusing data from different modalities to capture the interaction between the latent features and evaluate their complementary information in characterizing schizophrenia. Our deep model uses structural MRI, functional MRI, and genome-wide polymorphism data to perform the classification task. It includes a multi-layer feed-forward network, an encoder, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit with attention to learn the latent features and adopt a joint training scheme capturing synergies between the modalities. The hybrid network also uses different regularizers for addressing the inherent overfitting and modality-specific bias in the multi-modal setup. Next, we run the network through a saliency model to analyze the learned features. Integrating modalities enhances the performance of the classifier, and our framework acquired 88% (P < 0.0001) accuracy on a dataset of 437 subjects. The trimodal accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art performance on a data collection of this size and outperforms the unimodal and bimodal baselines we compared. Model introspection was used to expose the salient neural features and genes/biological pathways associated with schizophrenia. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach that fuses genomic information with structural and functional MRI biomarkers for predicting schizophrenia. We believe this type of modality blending can better explain the disorder's dynamics by adding cross-modal prospects.Clinical Relevance- This study combinedly learns imaging and genomic features for the classification of schizophrenia. The data fusion scheme extracts modality interactions, and the saliency experiments report multiple functional and structural networks closely connected to the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2079809846,"Abstract   Aim  P53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability as well as the control of cell growth and apoptosis. Recently, an uncommon  P53  genetic variant (rs78378222) was reported to be significantly associated with multiple cancers in Caucasians in a genome-wide association study. rs78378222 locates in the 3′-untranslated region of the  P53  gene, and this A-to-C polymorphism results in changes of the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, which leads to impaired 3′-end processing of  P53  mRNA and decreased  P53  expression.    Methods  We evaluated the association between this polymorphism and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk in a case–control cohort consisting of 405 ESCC patients and 810 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression.    Results  We did observe this polymorphism with low minor allele frequency in Chinese Han population. Additionally, significantly increased ESCC risk was associated with  P53  rs78378222 A > C polymorphism. Compared with rs78378222AA carriers, the OR of developing ESCC for AC carriers was 3.22 (95% CI = 1.71 − 6.33,  P  = 1.34 × 10 − 4 ).    Conclusion  These results suggest that this functional uncommon  P53  rs78378222 variant is associated with ESCC risk in the current Han Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W3119813232,"Interspecific hybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon that generates genetic variability in a population and fosters species diversity in nature. The availability of large genome scale data sets has revolutionized hybridization studies to shift from the observation of the presence or absence of hybrids to the investigation of the genomic constitution of hybrids and their genome-specific evolutionary dynamics. Although a handful of methods have been proposed in an attempt to identify hybrids, accurate detection of hybridization from genomic data remains a challenging task. In addition to methods that infer phylogenetic networks or that utilize pairwise divergence, site pattern frequency based and population genetic clustering approaches are popularly used in practice, though the performance of these methods under different hybridization scenarios has not been extensively examined. Here, we use simulated data to comparatively evaluate the performance of four tools that are commonly used to infer hybridization events: the site pattern frequency based methods HyDe and the $D$-statistic (i.e., the ABBA-BABA test) and the population clustering approaches structure and ADMIXTURE. We consider single hybridization scenarios that vary in the time of hybridization and the amount of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) for different proportions of parental contributions ($\gamma$); introgressive hybridization; multiple hybridization scenarios; and a mixture of ancestral and recent hybridization scenarios. We focus on the statistical power to detect hybridization and the false discovery rate (FDR) for comparisons of the $D$-statistic and HyDe, and the accuracy of the estimates of $\gamma$ as measured by the mean squared error for HyDe, structure, and ADMIXTURE. Both HyDe and the $D$-statistic are powerful for detecting hybridization in all scenarios except those with high ILS, although the $D$-statistic often has an unacceptably high FDR. The estimates of $\gamma$ in HyDe are impressively robust and accurate whereas structure and ADMIXTURE sometimes fail to identify hybrids, particularly when the proportional parental contributions are asymmetric (i.e., when $\gamma$ is close to 0). Moreover, the posterior distribution estimated using structure exhibits multimodality in many scenarios, making interpretation difficult. Our results provide guidance in selecting appropriate methods for identifying hybrid populations from genomic data. [ABBA-BABA test; ADMIXTURE; hybridization; HyDe; introgression; Patterson's $D$-statistic; Structure.]."
https://openalex.org/W2090849123,"Irregular atrial pressure, defective folate and cholesterol metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, little is known about the combined roles of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes, which are involved in metabolism and homeostasis. The objective of this study is to investigate the association of the MTHFR 677 C>T and 1298A>C, ACE insertion–deletion (I/D) and ApoE genetic polymorphisms with hypertension and to further explore the epistasis interactions that are involved in these mechanisms. A total of 594 subjects, including 348 normotensive and 246 hypertensive ischemic stroke subjects were recruited. The MTHFR 677 C>T and 1298A>C, ACE I/D and ApoEpolymorphisms were genotyped and the epistasis interaction were analyzed. The MTHFR 677 C>T and ApoE polymorphisms demonstrated significant associations with susceptibility to hypertension in multiple logistic regression models, multifactor dimensionality reduction and a classification and regression tree. In addition, the logistic regression model demonstrated that significant interactions between the ApoE E3E3, E2E4, E2E2 and MTHFR 677 C>T polymorphisms existed. In conclusion, the results of this epistasis study indicated significant association between the ApoE and MTHFR polymorphisms and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1988682083,"Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) was reported to have impact on the physiological arterial stiffness and vascular remodeling with hypertension of recent years. In the previous study we reported the association of four functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FBN1 gene and hypertension. Here, we further investigate the association of four tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) which covered remain genetic variation blocks of FBN1 gene with hypertension, blood pressure and efficacy of antihypertensive in a South Han Chinese population. A case–control study including 2,012 hypertension cases and 2,116 controls age- and sex-matched controls was conducted from a community-based population and four candidate tagSNPs of the FBN1 gene were genotyped. Association analysis by multiple logistic regression was conducted for allele, genotype and haplotype and hypertension, blood pressure trait and control status with antihypertensive. General linear model was applied to compare blood pressure levels between genotypes. The association of rs17361868 and hypertension was statistically significant and that was further observed in female, ≥55 years, non-smoking and non-drinking populations (P < 0.05). Significant association of rs668842, rs11635140 and hypertension were observed in <55 years population as well as the later in female and non-smoking populations respectively. Haplotype G-T constructed of rs668842 and rs11635140 was significantly associated with hypertension comparing to reference haplotype A-C (P = 0.022). Normally distributed square root of TGF-β1 (pg/ml) of hypertension cases (148.56 ± 66.46) was significantly higher than that of control (128.52 ± 65.11), P = 0.008. Furthermore, TGF-β1 was significantly correlated with SBP (r = 0.135, P = 0.018) and DBP (r = 0.154, P = 0.007) respectively whereas no statistical difference of blood pressure or TGF-β1 was observed between genotypes. Remarkably, rs17361868 were significantly associated with the status of blood pressure in the patients taking three of the antihypertensive drugs, Zhen Ju Jiang Ya tablets, Jiang Ya tablet and compound reserpine (P < 0.05). The present study provides further association evidence of FBN1 gene polymorphisms and hypertension, antihypertensive efficacy. Further replication of these results via association or prospective studies conducted in other populations is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2218426931,"Ancestral genome reconstruction has attracted increasing interests from both biologists and computer scientists. It has been conducted using various evolutionary models ever since comparative genomics moved from sequence data to gene order data. We propose a Flexible Ancestral Reconstruction Model, FARM, based on the maximum likelihood and weighted maximum matching algorithms, to infer ancestral gene orders. This will accommodate various evolutionary scenarios, including not only genomic rearrangements, but also insertion/deletions (indels), segment duplications, and whole genome duplications. We evaluate this work by using various simulated evolution experiments while comparing FARM to existing methods, like InferCarsPro, GASTS and PMAG++. FARM shows significant improvement in running time and the final assembling process and, therefore, can be used in large-scale real biological data ancestral inference."
https://openalex.org/W2560721981,"Antimicrobial resistance is an important public health concern that has implications in the practice of medicine worldwide. Accurately predicting resistance phenotypes from genome sequences shows great promise in promoting better use of antimicrobial agents, by determining which antibiotics are likely to be effective in specific clinical cases. In healthcare, this would allow for the design of treatment plans tailored for specific individuals, likely resulting in better clinical outcomes for patients with bacterial infections. In this work, we present the recent work of Drouin et al. (2016) on using Set Covering Machines to learn highly interpretable models of antibiotic resistance and complement it by providing a large scale application of their method to the entire PATRIC database. We report prediction results for 36 new datasets and present the Kover AMR platform, a new web-based tool allowing the visualization and interpretation of the generated models."
https://openalex.org/W2601934604,"Modular robots offer an important benefit in evolutionary robotics, which is to quickly evaluate evolved morphologies and control systems in reality. However, artificial evolution of simulated modular robotics is a difficult and time consuming task requiring significant computational power. While artificial evolution in virtual creatures has made use of powerful generative encodings, here we investigate how a generative encoding and direct encoding compare for the evolution of locomotion in modular robots when the number of robotic modules changes. Simulating less modules would decrease the size of the genome of a direct encoding while the size of the genome of the implemented generative encoding stays the same. We found that the generative encoding is significantly more efficient in creating robot phenotypes in the initial stages of evolution when simulating a maximum of 5, 10, and 20 modules. This not only confirms that generative encodings lead to decent performance more quickly, but also that when simulating just a few modules a generative encoding is more powerful than a direct encoding for creating robotic structures. Over longer evolutionary time, the difference between the encodings no longer becomes statistically significant. This leads us to speculate that a combined approach – starting with a generative encoding and later implementing a direct encoding – can lead to more efficient evolved designs."
https://openalex.org/W3182797586,"We present a new statistic for testing for neutral evolution from allele frequency data summarised as a site frequency spectrum, which we call the relative likelihood neutrality test or ρ. Classical methods of testing for natural selection, such as Tajima9s D and its relatives, require the null model to have constant population size over time and therefore can confound demographic change with natural selection. ρ can directly incorporate a null hypothesis reflecting general demographic histories. It has a natural Bayesian interpretation as an approximation to the log-probability of the null model, given the data. We use simulations to show that ρ has greater power than Tajima9s D to detect departure from neutrality for a range of scenarios of positive and negative selection. We also show how ρ can be adapted to account for sequencing error. Application to the ACKR1 (FYO) gene in humans supported previous studies inferring positive selection in sub-Saharan populations which were based on inter-population comparisons. However, we did not find the signal of selection to be maximal in the region of the FY*O or Duffy-null allele in these populations. We also applied ρ to investigate in greater detail a region on the 2q11.1 band of the human genome that has previously been identified as showing evidence of selection. This was done for a range of populations: for the European populations we incorporated a demographic history with a bottleneck corresponding to the putative out of Africa event. We were able to localise signals of selection to some specific regions and genes. Overall, we suggest that ρ will be a useful tool for identifying genomic regions that may be subject to natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W3144542670,"Oxidative damage promotes atherosclerosis. SOD2 is an important antioxidant enzyme. A case-control study and a meta-analysis were performed to assess the association of C47T polymorphism in SOD2 gene with premature, late-onset and overall coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. A hospital-based case-control study was con- ducted with 269 premature CAD cases, 278 late-onset CAD cases and 299 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Pyrosequencing were used to detect the poly- morphism. Multinomial logistic regression model was per- formed to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjust potential confounders. A meta- analysis was performed using eight outcomes including our result. Fixed or random effect pooled measure was selected on the basis of homogeneity test among studies. Heteroge- neity among studies was evaluated using I 2 . Meta-regression was used to explore potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated using Peters's linear regression test. In our case-control study, compared with the TT as the reference, the mutant genotype of CC ? TC was significantly associated with a reduced pre- mature CAD risk both in univariate (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.41-0.87) and multivariate (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.40-0.87) logistic regressions, but not with late-onset CAD risk. After excluding one article that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls, this meta-analysis showed a significant association of the C allele with reduced risk of CAD in dominant (FEM: OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.61-0.78), recessive (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.50-0.82), and codominant (FEM: OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.65-0.80) models. Our study suggested that the mutant genotype of CC ? TC was significantly associated with a reduced CAD risk."
https://openalex.org/W3174753298,"Personalized medicine, also known as precision medicine, refers to a medical model of providing the best treatment plan for a patient according to his or her personal genomic information. The research and practice of personalized medicine have become a hot topic in current medical research, and predicting the response of cell lines to specific drugs is one of the core problems. Using computer algorithms to predict the responses of cell lines to drugs based on huge amounts of existing omics information is currently one focus of bioinformatics. A variety of predictive methods have been proposed. The paper introduces the baseline analysis data, surveys some classical prediction methods and models, and details on the application of matrix decomposition, heterozygous network and deep learning at the drug response prediction. At last, some existing problems and future development trend and prospects are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W939299167,"We propose methods to integrate data across several genomic platforms using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis framework that incorporates the biological relationships among the platforms to identify genes whose expression is related to clinical outcomes in cancer. This integrated approach combines information across all platforms, leading to increased statistical power in finding these predictive genes, and further provides mechanistic information about the manner in which the gene affects the outcome. We demonstrate the advantages of the shrinkage estimation used by this approach through a simulation, and finally, we apply our method to a Glioblastoma Multiforme dataset and identify several genes potentially associated with the patients’ survival. We find 12 positive prognostic markers associated with nine genes and 13 negative prognostic markers associated with nine genes."
https://openalex.org/W3004599988,"The application of machine learning to inference problems in biology is dominated by supervised learning problems of regression and classification, and unsupervised learning problems of clustering and variants of low-dimensional projections for visualization. A class of problems that have not gained much attention is detecting outliers in datasets, arising from reasons such as gross experimental, reporting or labelling errors. These could also be small parts of a dataset that are functionally distinct from the majority of a population. Outlier data are often identified by considering the probability density of normal data and comparing data likelihoods against some threshold. This classical approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which is a serious problem with omics data which are often found in very high dimensions. We develop an outlier detection method based on structured low-rank approximation methods. The objective function includes a regularizer based on neighbourhood information captured in the graph Laplacian. Results on publicly available genomic data show that our method robustly detects outliers whereas a density-based method fails even at moderate dimensions. Moreover, we show that our method has better clustering and visualization performance on the recovered low-dimensional projection when compared with popular dimensionality reduction techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3159406973,"Motivation: Driver (epi)genomic alterations underlie the positive selection of cancer subpopulations, which promotes drug resistance and relapse. Even though substantial heterogeneity is witnessed in most cancer types, mutation accumulation patterns can be regularly found and can be exploited to reconstruct predictive models of cancer evolution. Yet, available methods cannot infer logical formulas connecting events to represent alternative evolutionary routes or convergent evolution. Results: We introduce PMCE, an expressive framework that leverages mutational profiles from cross-sectional sequencing data to infer probabilistic graphical models of cancer evolution including arbitrary logical formulas, and which outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise, on simulations. The application of PMCE to 7866 samples from the TCGA database allows us to identify a highly significant correlation between the predicted evolutionary paths and the overall survival in 7 tumor types, proving that our approach can effectively stratify cancer patients in reliable risk groups. Availability: PMCE is freely available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/PMCE, in addition to the code to replicate all the analyses presented in the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2070930739,"The identification of drug-target interactions, or interactions between drug candidate compounds and target candidate proteins, is a crucial process in genomic drug discovery. In silico chemogenomic methods are recently recognized as a promising approach for genome-wide scale prediction of drug-target interactions, but the prediction performance depends heavily on the descriptors and similarity measures of drugs and proteins. In this paper, we investigated the performance of various descriptors and similarity measures of drugs and proteins for the drug-target interaction prediction using a chemogenomic approach. We compared the prediction accuracy of 18 chemical descriptors of drugs (e.g., ECFP, FCFP,E-state, CDK, KlekotaRoth, MACCS, PubChem, Dragon, KCF-S, and graph kernels) and 4 descriptors of proteins (e.g., amino acid composition, domain profile, local sequence similarity, and string kernel) on about one hundred thousand drug-target interactions. We examined the combinatorial effects of drug descriptors and protein descriptors using the same benchmark data under several experimental conditions. Large-scale experiments showed that our proposed KCF-S descriptor worked the best in terms of prediction accuracy. The comparative results are expected to be useful for selecting chemical descriptors in various pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2793000921,"Abstract   Identifying cancer-causing mutated driver genes from passenger mutations is crucial to enhance the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, and many previous efforts have been undertaken to identify cancer driver genes from somatic mutation data of specific types of cancers. However, many driver genes are underestimated when the mutation data of only specific cancers are investigated, which complicates the understanding of tumorigenesis. According to recent studies, cancers of disparate organs have many shared genomic mutations, and some driver genes that are not highly frequently mutated in patients of one cancer type may display considerable mutation frequencies across patients of multiple cancer types. By taking into account both the similarities of mutation profiles of different cancer types and the information of gene interaction network, we propose a novel unsupervised learning model based on matrix tri-factorization by learning the similarities from pairwise constraints to detect driver genes from pan-cancer data. In the evaluation of known benchmarking genes, our model achieves better performance than those of the existing matrix factorization based methods which do not consider the pairwise similarities between cancers. Furthermore, the detection performance of our model is also largely increased (area under the precision-recall curve = 9.1% for Vogelstein genes) when compared with existing methods. Moreover, our model discovers some driver genes that have been reported in recent published studies, showing its potential for application in identifying driver gene candidates for further wet experimental verification."
https://openalex.org/W3185422236,"Chagas disease is an infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, endemic in Latino America. Leveraging the three-way admixture between Native American (AMR), European (EUR) and African (AFR) populations in Latin Americans, we aimed to better understand the genetic basis of Chagas disease by performing an admixture mapping study in a Colombian population. A two-stage study was conducted, and subjects were classified as seropositive and seronegative for T. cruzi. In stage 1, global and local ancestries were estimated using reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), and local ancestry associations were performed by logistic regression models. The AMR ancestry showed a protective association with Chagas disease within the major histocompatibility complex region [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-0.83, lowest P-value = 4.53 × 10-8]. The fine mapping assessment on imputed genotypes combining data from stage 1 and 2 from an independent Colombian cohort, revealed nominally associated variants in high linkage disequilibrium with the top signal (rs2032134, OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90-0.97, P-value = 3.54 × 10-4) in the previously associated locus. To assess ancestry-specific adaptive signals, a selective sweep scan in an AMR reference population from 1KGP together with an in silico functional analysis highlighted the Tripartite Motif family and the human leukocyte antigen genes, with crucial role in the immune response against pathogens. Furthermore, these analyses emphasized the macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, as key players in the defense against T. cruzi. This first admixture mapping study in Chagas disease provided novel insights underlying the host immune response in the pathogenesis of this neglected disease."
https://openalex.org/W2792529702,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease, have had a direct effect within Canada, while many more EIDs such as Zika, chikungunya and Ebola are a threat to Canadians while travelling. Over 75% of EIDs affecting humans are, or were originally, zoonoses (infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans). There are two main ways by which infectious diseases can emerge: by changes in their geographical ranges and by adaptive emergence, a genetic change in a microorganism that results in it becoming capable of invading a new niche, often by jumping to a new host species such as humans. Diseases can appear to emerge simply because we become capable of detecting and diagnosing them. Management of EID events is a key role of public health globally and a considerable challenge for clinical care. Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on predicting EID occurrence to get ahead of the curve - that is, allowing health systems to be poised to respond to them, and public health to be ready to prevent them. Predictive models estimate where and when EIDs may occur and the levels of risk they pose. Evaluation of the internal and external drivers that trigger emergence events is increasingly considered in predicting EID events. Currently, global changes are driving increasing occurrence of EIDs, but our capacity to prevent and deal with them is also increasing. Web-based scanning and analysis methods are increasingly allowing us to detect EID outbreaks, modern genomics and bioinformatics are increasing our ability to identify their genetic and geographical origins, while developments in geomatics and earth observation will enable more real-time tracking of outbreaks. EIDs will, however, remain a key, global public health challenge in a globalized world where demographic, climatic, and other environmental changes are altering the interactions between hosts and pathogen in ways that increase spillover from animals to humans and global spread."
https://openalex.org/W1965962538,"With the advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression and transcript variant discovery. In comparative experiments, differential expression analysis is commonly performed on RNA-seq data to identify genes/features that are differentially expressed between biological conditions. Most existing statistical methods for differential expression analysis are parametric and assume either Poisson distribution or negative binomial distribution on gene read counts. However, violation of distributional assumptions or a poor estimation of parameters often leads to unreliable results. In this paper, we introduce a new nonparametric approach called LFCseq that uses log fold changes as a differential expression test statistic. To test each gene for differential expression, LFCseq estimates a null probability distribution of count changes from a selected set of genes with similar expression strength. In contrast, the nonparametric NOISeq approach relies on a null distribution estimated from all genes within an experimental condition regardless of their expression levels. Through extensive simulation study and RNA-seq real data analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed approach could well rank the differentially expressed genes ahead of non-differentially expressed genes, thereby achieving a much improved overall performance for differential expression analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3213284092,"Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is characterized by a diverse group of congenital malformations induced by ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Type III interferons have been associated with placental immunity against ZIKV and restriction of vertical transmission in mice, and non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on these genes are well known to influence susceptibility to other viral infections. However, their effect on ZIKV pathogenesis has not yet been explored. To investigate whether maternal non-coding SNPs at IFNL genes are associated with CZS, 52 women infected with ZIKV during pregnancy were enrolled in a case-control association study. A total of 28 women were classified as cases and 24 as controls based on the presence or absence of CZS in their infants, and seven Interferon-λ non-coding SNPs (rs12980275, rs8099917, rs4803217, rs4803219, rs8119886, rs368234815, rs12979860) were genotyped. The results of logistic regression analyses show an association between the G allele at rs8099917 and increased susceptibility to CZS under a log-additive model (adjustedOR = 2.80; 95%CI = 1.14-6.91; p = 0.02), after adjustment for trimester of infection and genetic ancestry. These results provide evidence of an association between Interferon-λ SNPs and CZS, suggesting rs8099917 as a promising candidate for further studies on larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2980158339,"Background The development of inhibitors directed against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is a common and severe complication of hemophilia replacement therapy, occurring in up to one third of patients with severe hemophilia A (HA). Inhibitors impair efficacy of replacement therapy, rendering management of bleeds difficult and prophylaxis unfeasible. There is evidence that various genetic risk factors play an important role in inhibitor development; in particular, F8 mutation type. However, patients sharing the same mutation may have different inhibitor risk suggesting the presence of other genetic risk factors. Because most variants in the genome are rare and since variants within the protein-coding area (i.e. the exome) are expected to have a strong effect on phenotypes, we designed an exome sequencing study with the goal of assessing the role of rare, functional variants of the exome in inhibitor development.

Methods A total of 28 HA patients (8 pairs of related individuals and 12 unrelated subjects) underwent sequencing of the exome on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platforms following capture by hybridization on VCRome V2.1 liquid probes. Patients were selected among those followed at the Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (Milan, Italy). Inclusion criteria were (a) diagnosis of severe HA, with plasmatic FVIII activity below 1%, and the presence of intron 22 or intron 1 inversion of F8 . Mapping of reads onto the human reference genome (hg19/NCBI build 37.1) was performed by BWA and variant calling by GATK. We restricted our analysis to functional variants (i.e. missense, nonsense, splice-site variants and coding indels) that are rare in Caucasian populations (i.e. with a minor allele frequency below 0.5% in the European Americans of the exome variant server). For association analysis, we carried out burden-testing association using (a) SKAT-O test, as well as gene-based association by (b) Fisher’s exact testing and (c) mixed-effects logistic regression analysis adjusted for familial clustering. The lists of top 100-genes and genes with p<0.05 identified with each approach were studied for their overlapping and enrichment for immunity genes (immunome knowledge base).

Results A total of 1.9 billion reads were generated to sequence the exome of 28 HA patients at an average coverage of 77X (range: 49-96X). Coverage was homogeneous, with an average of 95% (range: 93-96%) of the 43 Mb of target being covered by at least 10 high-quality reads. On average, patients had 695 (range: 569-838) rare, functional variants in their exome, with a total of 6654 genes having at least one variant of that type in at least one individual. Association analysis revealed a total of 252 genes associated with inhibitor development at p<0.05 with SKAT-O test, 45 with Fisher’s exact test and 19 with mixed-effects logistic regression. Genes associated with inhibitor development using different tests showed good overlapping, especially Fisher’s exact test and mixed-effects logistic regression (Figure). A total of 8 genes were associated with inhibitors using all three techniques (i.e. RHBG, CEACAM7, CTAGE6P, SEC22B, C5orf49, DAB1, SORL1, PKD1L1 ). These encode proteins involved in cell-adhesion, ammonium transportation, vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. The lists of associated genes showed slight (if any) enrichment for genes of the immune system using SKAT-O (odds ratio [OR]: 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-2.3) and mixed-effect logistic regression (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 0.3-11.0), and no enrichment at Fisher’s exact test (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.1-4.0).

https://openalex.org/W2886630736,"Objective  The main objective in studying large-scale cancer omics is to identify molecular mechanisms of cancer and discover novel biomedical targets. This work not only discovers the cancer subtypes in genome scale data by using clustering and classification but also measures their accuracy.  Methods  Initially, candidate cancer subtypes are recognized by max-flow/min-cut graph clustering. Finally, prognosis-enhanced neural network classifier is proposed for classification. We analyzed the heterogeneity and identified the subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive adult brain tumor, from 215 samples with microRNA expression (12 042 genes). The samples were classified into 4 different classes such as mesenchymal, classical, proneural, and neural subtypes owing to mutations and gene expression. The results are measured using the metrics such as silhouette width, biological stability index, clustering accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure.  Results  Max-flow/min-cut clustering produces higher clustering accuracy of 88.93% for 215 samples. The proposed prognosis-enhanced neural network classifier algorithm produces higher accuracy results of 89.2% for 215 samples efficiently.  Conclusion  From the experimental results, the proposed prognosis-enhanced neural network classifier is seen as an alternative, which is full of promise for cancer subtype prediction in genome scale data."
https://openalex.org/W4205747071,"With the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, the problem of antibiotic resistance has become a major challenge in healthcare. Therefore, the accurate identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria is particularly urgent and important. Although culture-based methods can accurately identify ARGs, they are limited by domain knowledge and are time-consuming. With the availability of whole genome sequence data, most existing methods rely on sequence alignment to calculate sequence similarity to predict ARGs. However, for ARGs that has low sequence identity with known sequences, the existing methods do not identify them well. To address the challenges, we propose a multiple view learning based framework for ARGs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than the selected representative baselines on the real-world dataset."

ACYP2 was found to associated with telomere length, the aim of this study was to identify whether ACYP2 polymorphisms increase or decrease HAPE risk in the Chinese Han individuals.In present study, we have genotyped 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACYP2 to determine the haplotypes in a case-control study with 265 HAPE patients and 303 healthy individuals. Genotypes were determined using the Sequenom MassARRAY method. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for gender and age. We found 3 SNPs yielded significant evidence for association with HAPE risk which had not been investigated before. Rs6713088 was found to have a 1.85- and 1.30-fold increased risk of HAPE in the recessive and additive model. The GT of rs843752 also conferred an increased risk of HAPE (GT/TT: OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.05-2.16, P = 0.026) and the genotype frequency distributions of rs843752 had significant difference between cases and controls. The CC genotype of rs17045754 had a protect effect on HAPE patients, and it was found to have a 0.29-fold reduced risk of HAPE in the recessive model.Although additional, larger population-based studies are needed to confirm these findings, our study shed light on the association between ACYP2 variant and HAPE risk in Han Chinese population for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W4206975940,"The world currently is going through a serious pandemic due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, we investigate the gene structure similarity of coronavirus genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients and bats genes. We also explore the extent of similarity between their genome structures to find if the new coronavirus is similar to either of the other genome structures. Our experimental results show that there is 82.42% similarity between the CoV-2 genome structure and the bat genome structure. Moreover, we have used a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model as the deep learning technique and an improved variant of Recurrent Neural networks (i.e., Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory model) to classify the protein families of these genomes to isolate the prominent protein family accession. The accuracy of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is 98% for labeled protein sequences against the protein families. By comparing the performance of the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model results, we found that the GRU model is 1.6% more accurate than the Bi-LSTM model for our multiclass protein classification problem. Our experimental results would be further support medical research purposes in targeting the protein family similarity to better understand the coronavirus genomic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2798787647,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to discover the genetic basis of complex phenotypes. However, standard single-SNP GWASs suffer from lack of power. In particular, they do not directly account for linkage disequilibrium, that is the dependences between SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). We present the comparative study of two multilocus GWAS strategies, in the random forest-based framework. The first method, T-Trees, was designed by Botta and collaborators (Botta et al., PLoS ONE 9(4):e93379, 2014). We designed the other method, which is an innovative hybrid method combining T-Trees with the modeling of linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is modeled through a collection of tree-shaped Bayesian networks with latent variables, following our former works (Mourad et al., BMC Bioinformatics 12(1):16, 2011). We compared the two methods, both on simulated and real data. For dominant and additive genetic models, in either of the conditions simulated, the hybrid approach always slightly performs better than T-Trees. We assessed predictive powers through the standard ROC technique on 14 real datasets. For 10 of the 14 datasets analyzed, the already high predicted power observed for T-Trees (0.910-0.946) can still be increased by up to 0.030. We also assessed whether the distributions of SNPs’ scores obtained from T-Trees and the hybrid approach differed. Finally, we thoroughly analyzed the intersections of top 100 SNPs output by any two or the three methods amongst T-Trees, the hybrid approach, and the single-SNP method. The sophistication of T-Trees through finer linkage disequilibrium modeling is shown beneficial. The distributions of SNPs’ scores generated by T-Trees and the hybrid approach are shown statistically different, which suggests complementary of the methods. In particular, for 12 of the 14 real datasets, the distribution tail of highest SNPs’ scores shows larger values for the hybrid approach. Thus are pinpointed more interesting SNPs than by T-Trees, to be provided as a short list of prioritized SNPs, for a further analysis by biologists. Finally, among the 211 top 100 SNPs jointly detected by the single-SNP method, T-Trees and the hybrid approach over the 14 datasets, we identified 72 and 38 SNPs respectively present in the top25s and top10s for each method."
https://openalex.org/W2790647484,"Cell subtype proportional differences between samples significantly contribute to variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation.  Current analytical approaches typically deal with cell subtype proportion influences as a nuisance variable to be eliminated.  Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data provides insights into the cellular events in human phenotypes.  We note a striking concordance between cell subtype proportions estimated from orthogonal genome-wide assays, and demonstrate the potential for single-cell RNA-seq data to be used in tissues for which reference cell subtype functional genomic datasets are not available.  Taken together, our results confirm the importance of estimating cell subtype proportions when testing a model of cellular reprogramming in human phenotypic association studies, and the value of simultaneously testing for systematic cell subtype proportional alterations as a separate phenotypic association, gaining extra insights from functional genomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W4200050134,"High dimensionality and class imbalance have been largely recognized as important issues in machine learning. A vast amount of literature has indeed investigated suitable approaches to address the multiple challenges that arise when dealing with high-dimensional feature spaces (where each problem instance is described by a large number of features). As well, several learning strategies have been devised to cope with the adverse effects of imbalanced class distributions, which may severely impact on the generalization ability of the induced models. Nevertheless, although both the issues have been largely studied for several years, they have mostly been addressed separately, and their combined effects are yet to be fully understood. Indeed, little research has been so far conducted to investigate which approaches might be best suited to deal with datasets that are, at the same time, high-dimensional and class-imbalanced. To make a contribution in this direction, our work presents a comparative study among different learning strategies that leverage both feature selection, to cope with high dimensionality, as well as cost-sensitive learning methods, to cope with class imbalance. Specifically, different ways of incorporating misclassification costs into the learning process have been explored. Also different feature selection heuristics have been considered, both univariate and multivariate, to comparatively evaluate their effectiveness on imbalanced data. The experiments have been conducted on three challenging benchmarks from the genomic domain, gaining interesting insight into the beneficial impact of combining feature selection and cost-sensitive learning, especially in the presence of highly skewed data distributions."
https://openalex.org/W3098713328,"MotivationLong read sequencing has increased the accuracy and completeness of assemblies of various organisms genomes in recent months. Similarly, spliced alignments of long read RNA sequencing hold the promise of delivering much longer transcripts of existing and novel isoforms in known genes without the need for error-prone transcript assemblies from short reads. However, low coverage and high-error rates potentially hamper the widespread adoption of long-read spliced alignments in annotation updates and isoform-level expression quantifications.  ResultsAddressing these issues, we first develop a simulation of error modes for both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio CCS spliced-alignments. Based on this we train a Random Forest classifier to assign new long-read alignments to one of two error categories, a novel category, or label them as non-error. We use this classifier to label reads from the spliced-alignments of the popular aligner minimap2, run on three long read sequencing datasets, including NA12878 from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio CCS, as well as a PacBio SKBR3 cancer cell line. Finally, we compare the intron chains of the three long read alignments against individual splice sites, short read assemblies, and the output from the FLAIR pipeline on the same samples.  Our results demonstrate a substantial lack of precision in determining exact splice sites for long reads during alignment on both platforms while showing some benefit from postprocessing. This work motivates the need for both better aligners and additional post-alignment processing to adjust incorrectly called putative splice-sites and clarify novel transcripts support.

https://openalex.org/W3111367721,"Phenotypic drug discovery focuses on screening for an effect in cells (the phenotype) while being agnostic to the mechanism and target of the compound.

Starting with assay development, machine learning can be used to prioritize good chemical probes to help the project team design and validate a robust screen. During hit discovery and triage, an iterative screening and machine-learning strategy can enable screening in complex cell models that would otherwise not be amenable. During target deconvolution and lead optimization computational models capitalize on decades of science to prioritize target hypotheses using data from orthogonal platforms both within our organization and outside.

Critical to these steps are not only the computational methods but also well-organized, curated data that capture the history of experiments.

https://openalex.org/W3081061859,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, which accounts for a proportion of nearly 85%. The increasing availability of genome-wide gene expression data has facilitated the identification of gene signatures that are significant to the precise classification of NSCLC subtypes and personalized treatment decisions. Unsupervised feature selection is an effective computational technique for searching the most discriminative feature subset to distinguish different classes and find the potential information embedded in biological data. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised feature selection method to identify the gene signatures for NSCLC subtype classification based on gene expression data. The proposed method incorporated linear discriminant analysis, adaptive structure preservation, and    $l_{2,1}$   -norm sparse regression into a joint learning framework for unsupervised feature selection to select the informative genes. An effective algorithm was developed to solve the optimization problem in the proposed method. Furthermore, we performed module-based gene filtering before feature selection to reduce the computational cost. We evaluated the proposed method on a gene expression dataset of NSCLC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The experimental results show that the proposed method identified a small number of gene signatures for accurate NSCLC subtype classification. Enrichment analysis of the identified gene signatures was also performed by summarizing the key biological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2888592285,"BACKGROUND Cigarette smoking remains a serious public health problem. Environmental and genetic factors both play critical roles in the process of cigarette smoking. We aimed to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the BDNF gene and cigarette smoking in the Iranian population. METHODS We conducted a case-control study. In total, 932 case and control subjects aged > 15 years were recruited in the present study in a simple random manner, including 523 lifetime cigarette smokers, 466 cigarette smokers within a 12-month period, 409 never cigarette smokers in their lifetime and 466 never cigarette smokers within a 12-month period. The rs6265 SNP genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. To examine the association of smoking with the BDNF gene polymorphism, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS In total, 932 participants (758 males and 174 females) were selected. Using a chi-squared test, we found that rs6265 with OR = 1.41 and 95% CI = 1.07-1.87 (p = 0.009) and OR = 1.41 and 95% CI = 1.08-1.85 (p = 0.008) in the BNDF was associated with an increased odds of lifetime cigarette smoking and cigarette smoking within a 12-month period, respectively. Also, the allele A of rs6265 in BDNF had a significant elevating effect for cigarette smoking in a recessive model (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that polymorphisms of BDNF play an important role in lifetime cigarette smoking and cigarette smoking within a 12-month period of susceptibility in the Iranian population."
https://openalex.org/W3041700918,"The use of biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulatory networks is becoming an integral part of biological research in the genomics era. However, these networks are not static, and during phenotypic transitions like disease onset, they can acquire new communities of genes that carry out key cellular processes. Changes in community structure can be detected by maximizing a modularity-based score, but because biological systems and network inference algorithms are inherently noisy, it remains a challenge to determine whether these changes represent real cellular responses or whether they appeared by random chance. Here, we introduce Constrained Random Alteration of Network Edges (CRANE), a computational method that samples networks with fixed node strengths to identify a null distribution and assess the robustness of observed changes in network structure. In contrast with other approaches, such as consensus clustering or established network generative models, CRANE produces more biologically realistic results and performs better in simulations. When applied to breast and ovarian cancer networks, CRANE improves the recovery of cancer-relevant GO terms while reducing the signal from non-specific housekeeping processes. CRANE is a general tool that can be applied in tandem with a variety of stochastic community detection methods to evaluate the veracity of their results."
https://openalex.org/W2958514956,"Advancements in the field of genomics and proteomics have led to the development of high throughput methods that generate data on a large scale. Categorization of the data thus generated can help us better understand the nature of data, make generalizations and track changes during perturbations. The methods that currently exist for protein characterization have input limitation and run complex algorithms to find known patterns in sequences thereby requiring high computation capabilities and time. The pileup of datasets generated by methods like genome sequencing or expression profiles of different cancers have necessitated the decryption of patterns and ability to make predictions. The work described here focuses on using a deep neural network to create a model that learns to categorize a given set of proteins and predict if a new protein belongs to either. Manually annotated data was gathered for the desired categorization – E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway. Processed data was then used to train the neural network to achieve a validation accuracy of 97.68 % with a validation loss of 0.0771. The trained model was used to predict 25 new E2s and >3000 E3s from a sample of 5000 proteins interacting with E3s. The predicted E2s contain the UBCc domain indicating the model also learnt to identify the UBCc domain from sequences of 193 E2s. By adjusting the model parameters, the model can be used for categorizing any number proteins or to find new domains. Advantage of this model being a learning model is that its performance only improves with addition of data."

We present a Bayesian method of base calling, BM-BC, for Solexa-GA sequencing data. The Bayesian method builds on a hierarchical model that accounts for three sources of noise in the data, which are known to affect the accuracy of the base calls: fading, phasing, and cross-talk between channels. We show that the new method improves the precision of base calling compared with currently leading methods. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a probability score that measures the confidence of each base call.

https://openalex.org/W2885294405,"It is common to measure a large number of features in parallel to identify those differing between two experimental conditions - e.g. the search for differentially expressed genes using microarrays or RNA-Seq. Ranking features by p-value allows for control of the TYPE I error, but p-values are not reliable when there are very few replicates; and investigators typically require features be ranked by   x¯/y¯ in conjunction with p-values. At first glance the fold change appears to be a natural quantity on which to compare the differential behavior of features. But it is highly sensitive to small values in the denominator and is problematic in how it equates changes in both small and large numbers such as a change from 1 to 2 versus a change from 100 to 200. The strategy of adjusting all values by adding one is a widely used heuristic approach to try to mitigate the problems with fold-change. However, that can be far from optimal. A systematic strategy to determine an optimal value (pseudocount) to adjust by is employed using both real and simulated benchmark data. In RNA-Seq a value of 20 appears to be close to optimal in all cases. Another strategy is to sort by difference y¯ - x¯, but this is problematic for comparing measurements across a wide spectum, as large differences of small values rank below proportionally smaller difference in large values. An abstract mathematical framework is introduced to describe the problem of ranking by differential effect size, enabling us to study the ranking problem in general as opposed to specific contexts such as fold-change or difference. From this framework we discovered a remarkable property of pseudocounts, in that they strike a balance between sorting by fold-change and sorting by difference. Lastly, another fundamentally different type of application is presented, which is to rank di-codons by their differential abundance in the ORFeome of different species."

Differences in scalp hair morphology are significant at the worldwide scale and within Europe. The only genome-wide association study made to date revealed the Trichohyalin gene (TCHH) to be significantly associated with hair morphology in Europeans and reported weaker associations for WNT10A and FRAS1 genes. We conducted a study that centered on six SNPs located in these three genes with a sample of 528 individuals from Poland. The predictive capacity of the candidate DNA variants was evaluated using logistic regression; classification and regression trees; and neural networks, by applying a 10-fold cross validation procedure. Additionally, an independent test set of 142 males from six European populations was used to verify performance of the developed prediction models. Our study confirmed association of rs11803731 (TCHH), rs7349332 (WNT10A) and rs1268789 (FRAS1) SNPs with hair morphology. The combined genotype risk score for straight hair had an odds ratio of 2.7 and these predictors explained ∼8.2% of the total variance. The selected three SNPs were found to predict straight hair with a high sensitivity but low specificity when a 10-fold cross validation procedure was applied and the best results were obtained using the neural networks approach (AUC = 0.688, sensitivity = 91.2%, specificity = 23.0%). Application of the neural networks model with 65% probability threshold on an additional test set gave high sensitivity (81.4%) and improved specificity (50.0%) with a total of 78.7% correct calls, but a high non-classification rate (66.9%). The combined TTGGGG SNP genotype for rs11803731, rs7349332, rs1268789 (European frequency = 4.5%) of all six straight hair-associated alleles was identified as the best predictor, giving >80% probability of straight hair. Finally, association testing of 44 SNPs previously identified to be associated with male pattern baldness revealed a suggestive association with hair morphology for rs4679955 on 3q25.1. The study results reported provide the starting point for the development of a predictive test for hair morphology in Europeans. More studies are now needed to discover additional determinants of hair morphology to improve the predictive accuracy of this trait in forensic analysis."

Consanguineous marriage was found in 15 (11.5%) cases in which 3 (2.3%) cases had chromosomal aberrations. Recurrent abortion was the main clinical indication (18.3%) followed by infertility (15.3%). Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 26 patients (19.8%); of these, 20 (15.2%) involved autosomes, while only 6 (4.6%) involved gonosomes. Trisomy 21 was detected in 12 (9.1%) patients and Philadelphia chromosome was found in 8 (6.1%) patients. Turner syndrome was detected in 5 (3.8%) patients and Klinefelter syndrome was found in 1 (0.8%) patient.    Conclusion:  The precise delineation of different types of chromosomal aberrations is only possible using clinical examination and advanced cytogenetic tools by experienced cytogeneticists.

https://openalex.org/W3144260862,"MOTIVATION Metagenomic approaches hold the potential to characterize microbial communities and unravel the intricate link between the microbiome and biological processes. Assembly is one of the most critical steps in metagenomics experiments. It consists of transforming overlapping DNA sequencing reads into sufficiently accurate representations of the community's genomes. This process is computationally difficult and commonly results in genomes fragmented across many contigs. Computational binning methods are used to mitigate fragmentation by partitioning contigs based on their sequence composition, abundance, or chromosome organization into bins representing the community's genomes. Existing binning methods have been principally tuned for bacterial genomes and do not perform favorably on viral metagenomes. RESULTS We propose CoCoNet (Composition and Coverage Network), a new binning method for viral metagenomes that leverages the flexibility and the effectiveness of deep learning to model the co-occurrence of contigs belonging to the same viral genome and provide a rigorous framework for binning viral contigs. Our results show that CoCoNet substantially outperforms existing binning methods on viral datasets. AVAILABILITY CoCoNet was implemented in Python and is available for download on PyPi.

https://openalex.org/W2944677050,"Background: Previous studies indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). To evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of genes and IgAN risk, we performed a case-control study in a Chinese Han population. Materials: Twelve SNPs were selected and genotyped in 384 IgAN patients and 357 healthy controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression adjusted for age and gender. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to analyze the interaction of SNP-SNP with IgAN risk. Results: Our study demonstrated that IL-16 rs859 (OR = 0.75, p = 0.040) and CYP19A1 rs4646 (OR = 2.58, p = 0.017) polymorphism were related to the risk of IgAN. In stratified analyses by gender, CYP19A1 rs4646 (OR = 2.96, p = 0.015) and BACH1 rs372883 (OR = 1.81, p = 0.038) polymorphisms conferred susceptibility to IgAN in males. Besides, rs372883 reduced IgAN risk in females (OR = 0.44, p = 0.042). We also found rs859 polymorphism was correlated with grade I-II (OR = 0.42, p = 0.028) in subgroup analysis of Lee’s classification. Additionally, we found rs4646 polymorphism was correlated with serum creatinine (p = 0.035). Conclusion: Our results suggested that the IL-16 rs859, CYP19A1 rs4646, and BACH1 rs372883 polymorphisms have potential roles in the genetic susceptibility to IgAN in Chinese Han population."
https://openalex.org/W2187819791,"1. Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and vital to the services they provide. The essential role of microbes is due to high levels of functional diversity, which are, however, not always mirrored in morphological differentiation hampering their taxonomic identification. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders the measurement of morphological and behavioural traits at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. 2. Recent advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital image analysis are promising approaches, however they miss out on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behaviour of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioural information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. 3. We introduce bemovi, a package using R–the statistical computing environment–and the free image analysis software ImageJ. Bemovi is an automated digital video processing and analysis work flow to extract abundance and morphological and movement data for numerous individuals on a video, hence characterizing a population or community by multiple traits. Through a set of functions, bemovi identifies individuals present in a video and reconstruct their movement trajectories through space and time, merges measurements from all treated videos into a single database to which information on experimental conditions is added, readily available for further analysis in R. 4. We illustrate the validity, precision and accuracy of the method for experimental multi-species communities of protists in aquatic microcosms. We show the high correspondence between manual and automatic counts of individuals and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology and behaviour are constructed. We demonstrate how the data from videos can be used in combination with supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically classify individuals according to the species they belong to, and that information on movement behaviour can substantially improve the predictive ability and helps to distinguish morphologically similar species. In principle, bemovi should be able to extract from videos information about other types of organism, including microbes, so long as the individuals move relatively fast compared to their background."

We develop an interactive exploration tool, GENVISAGE, which rapidly discovers the most discriminative feature pairs that separate two classes of genomic objects and then displays the corresponding visualizations. Since quickly finding top feature pairs is computationally challenging, especially for large numbers of objects and features, we propose a suite of optimizations to make GENVISAGE responsive at scale and demonstrate that our optimizations lead to a 400× speedup over competitive baselines for multiple biological datasets. We apply our rapid and interpretable tool to identify literature-supported pairs of genes whose transcriptomic responses significantly discriminate several chemotherapy drug treatments.

We carried out a large case–control study among 1193 CHD patients and 1200 unrelated healthy control subjects. Information on the participants' health status was collected through the modified Inter-heart questionnaire. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples was analyzed for the genotypes of rs3737964 and rs3737965 SNPs on the CLC-6 gene using Taqman probe-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We compared the collected data between the case group and the control group by chi-square test and t/nonparametric test. Furthermore, we performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with CHD. The frequency of TT genotypes in rs3737964 was significantly higher in CHD patients compared to the control group, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.32 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.17–4.06, P = 0.016). The association of CHD with TT genotype was even stronger in smoking population after adjusting for confounders (OR = 3.19, 95% CI: 1.04–9.79, P = 0.043). Multivariate logistic regression showed the CHD risk associated with TT genotype in rs3737964 was particularly among population who were more than 60 years old, smoking, and male (P = 0.023, 0.008 and 0.043, respectively). The present study has revealed that rs3737964 SNP of CLC-6 was associated with CHD. In particular, subjects with TT genotype who were 60-plus years old, with smoking habit or were male were more susceptible to CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2132069521,"Many genetic markers have been shown to be associated with common quantitative traits in genome-wide association studies. Typically these associated genetic markers have small to modest effect sizes and individually they explain only a small amount of the variability of the phenotype. In order to build a genetic prediction model without fitting a multiple linear regression model with possibly hundreds of genetic markers as predictors, researchers often summarize the joint effect of risk alleles into a genetic score that is used as a covariate in the genetic prediction model. However, the prediction accuracy can be highly variable and selecting the optimal number of markers to be included in the genetic score is challenging. In this manuscript we present a strategy to build an ensemble of genetic prediction models from data and we show that the ensemble-based method makes the challenge of choosing the number of genetic markers more amenable. Using simulated data with varying heritability and number of genetic markers, we compare the predictive accuracy and inclusion of true positive and false positive markers of a single genetic prediction model and our proposed ensemble method. The results show that the ensemble of genetic models tends to include a larger number of genetic variants than a single genetic model and it is more likely to include all of the true genetic markers. This increased sensitivity is obtained at the price of a lower specificity that appears to minimally affect the predictive accuracy of the ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W2913816108,"Phenotyping is the current bottleneck in plant breeding, especially because next-generation sequencing has decreased genotyping cost more than 100.000 fold in the last 20 years. Therefore, the cost of phenotyping needs to be optimized within a breeding program. When designing the implementation of genomic selection scheme into the breeding cycle, breeders need to select the optimal method for (1) selecting training populations that maximize genomic prediction accuracy and (2) to reduce the cost of phenotyping while improving precision. In this article, we compared methods for selecting training populations under two scenarios: Firstly, when the objective is to select a training population set (TRS) to predict the remaining individuals from the same population (Untargeted), and secondly, when a test set (TS) is first defined and genotyped, and then the TRS is optimized specifically around the TS (Targeted). Our results show that optimization methods that include information from the test set (targeted) showed the highest accuracies, indicating that apriori information from the TS improves genomic predictions. In addition, predictive ability enhanced especially when population size was small which is a target to decrease phenotypic cost within breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2963144883,"Clustering cancer patients into subgroups and identifying cancer subtypes is an important task in cancer genomics. Clustering based on comprehensive multi-omic molecular profiling can often achieve better results than those using a single data type, since each omic data type may contain complementary information. However, it is challenging to integrate heterogeneous omic data directly. Based on one popular method – Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we presented Affinity Network Fusion (ANF), an “upgrade” of SNF with several advantages. Similar to SNF, ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity matrix for clustering. We applied ANF to a harmonized TCGA dataset consisting of 2193 patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct disease types. Our experimental results also demonstrated the power of feature selection and transformation combined with using ANF in patient clustering. Moreover, eigengap analysis suggests that the learned affinity matrices of four cancer types using our proposed framework may have successfully captured patient group structure and can be used for discovering unknown cancer subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2987532941,"Selective sweeps, the genetic footprint of positive selection, have been extensively studied in the past decades, with dozens of methods developed to identify swept regions. However, these methods suffer from both false positive and false negative reports, and the candidates identified with different methods are often inconsistent with each other. We propose that a biological cause of this problem can be population subdivision, and a technical cause can be incomplete, or inaccurate, modeling of the dynamic process associated with sweeps. Here we used simulations to show how these effects interact and potentially cause bias. In particular, we show that sweeps maybe misclassified as either hard or soft, when the true time stage of a sweep and that implied, or pre-supposed, by the model do not match. We call this “temporal misclassification”. Similarly, “spatial misclassification (softening)” can occur when hard sweeps, which are imported by migration into a new subpopulation, are falsely identified as soft. This can easily happen in case of local adaptation, i.e. when the sweeping allele is not under positive selection in the new subpopulation, and the underlying model assumes panmixis instead of substructure. The claim that most sweeps in the evolutionary history of humans were soft, may have to be reconsidered in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2593759575,"Clinical pathology relies on manual compartmentalization and quantification of biological structures, which is time
consuming and often error-prone. Application of computer vision segmentation algorithms to histopathological image
analysis, in contrast, can offer fast, reproducible, and accurate quantitative analysis to aid pathologists. Algorithms tunable
to different biologically relevant structures can allow accurate, precise, and reproducible estimates of disease states. In this
direction, we have developed a fast, unsupervised computational method for simultaneously separating all biologically
relevant structures from histopathological images in multi-scale. Segmentation is achieved by solving an energy
optimization problem. Representing the image as a graph, nodes (pixels) are grouped by minimizing a Potts model
Hamiltonian, adopted from theoretical physics, modeling interacting electron spins. Pixel relationships (modeled as edges)
are used to update the energy of the partitioned graph. By iteratively improving the clustering, the optimal number of
segments is revealed. To reduce computational time, the graph is simplified using a Cantor pairing function to intelligently
reduce the number of included nodes. The classified nodes are then used to train a multiclass support vector machine to
apply the segmentation over the full image. Accurate segmentations of images with as many as 106 pixels can be completed
only in 5 sec, allowing for attainable multi-scale visualization. To establish clinical potential, we employed our method in
renal biopsies to quantitatively visualize for the first time scale variant compartments of heterogeneous intra- and extraglomerular
structures simultaneously. Implications of the utility of our method extend to fields such as oncology,

Considering the fact that an intron may have multiple branchpoints, we transform the branchpoint prediction as the multi-label learning problem, and attempt to predict branchpoint sites from intron sequences. First, we investigate a variety of intron sequence-derived features, such as sparse profile, dinucleotide profile, position weight matrix profile, Markov motif profile and polypyrimidine tract profile. Second, we consider several multi-label learning methods: partial least squares regression, canonical correlation analysis and regularized canonical correlation analysis, and use them as the basic classification engines. Third, we propose two ensemble learning schemes which integrate different features and different classifiers to build ensemble learning systems for the branchpoint prediction. One is the genetic algorithm-based weighted average ensemble method; the other is the logistic regression-based ensemble method. In the computational experiments, two ensemble learning methods outperform benchmark branchpoint prediction methods, and can produce high-accuracy results on the benchmark dataset."

In the study, 91 aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) cases and 152 healthy controls of Chinese Han population were examined. Six common polymorphisms of genes, including multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 and M1, were determined. Associations between their genotypes with AAN risk were calculated using an unconditional logistic regression model. Among the six candidate polymorphisms, only the distribution frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was significantly higher among AAN cases compared with controls (P = 0.041, 62.6% vs. 48.7%) and was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk (OR = 1.728, 95%CI: 1.013–2.948, P = 0.045) of developing AAN, after adjustment for age and gender. The stratified analysis further showed that the GSTT1 null genotype was dominant in slow progressive AAN  patients (OR = 2.497, 95%CI: 1.028–6.064, P = 0.043). The GSTM1 genotypes were not shown to influence the development of AAN.

For the latter one, we developed a distributed genetic algorithm on HTCondor to perform feature selection. Moreover, we employed two widely used classification algorithms libSVM and random forest with different settings to analyze the influence on the overall classification performance. In this study we analyzed 5 human retro virus genomes; Human endogenous retrovirus K113, Hepatitis B virus (strain ayw), Human T lymphotropic virus 1, Human T lymphotropic virus 2, Human immunodeficiency virus 2, and Human immunodeficiency virus 1.

https://openalex.org/W3004684361,"Human aging is linked to many prevalent diseases. The aging process is highly influenced by genetic factors. Hence, it is important to identify human aging-related genes. We focus on supervised prediction of such genes. Gene expression-based methods for this purpose study genes in isolation from each other. While protein-protein interaction (PPI) network-based methods for this purpose account for interactions between genes' protein products, current PPI network data are context-unspecific, spanning different biological conditions. Instead, here, we focus on an aging-specific subnetwork of the entire PPI network, obtained by integrating aging-specific gene expression data and PPI network data. The potential of such data integration has been recognized but mostly in the context of cancer. So, we are the first to propose a supervised learning framework for predicting aging-related genes from an aging-specific PPI subnetwork. We find that using an aging-specific subnetwork indeed yields more accurate aging-related gene predictions than using the entire network. Also, predictive methods from our framework that have not previously been used for supervised prediction of aging-related genes outperform existing prominent methods for the same purpose. These results justify the need for our framework."

OBJECTIVES The main objective of the present study is to analyze in the Iberian population the effect of 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with NOA in Han Chinese through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and to establish their possible functional relevance in the development of specific SpF patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS We genotyped 674 Iberian infertile men (including 480 NOA and 194 SO patients) and 1058 matched unaffected controls for the GWAS-associated variants PRMT6-rs12097821, PEX10-rs2477686, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, IL17A-rs13206743, ABLIM1-rs7099208, and SOX5-rs10842262. Their association with SpF, SO, NOA, and different NOA phenotypes was evaluated by logistic regression models, and their functional relevance was defined by comprehensive interrogation of public resources. RESULTS ABLIM1-rs7099208 was associated with SpF under both additive (OR = 0.86, p = 0.036) and dominant models (OR = 0.78, p = 0.026). The CDC42BPA-rs3000811 minor allele frequency was significantly increased in the subgroup of NOA patients showing maturation arrest (MA) of germ cells compared to the remaining NOA cases under the recessive model (OR = 4.45, p = 0.044). The PEX10-rs2477686 SNP was associated with a negative testicular sperm extraction (TESE) outcome under the additive model (OR = 1.32, p = 0.034). The analysis of functional annotations suggested that these variants affect the testis-specific expression of nearby genes and that lincRNA may play a role in SpF. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the association of three previously reported NOA risk variants in Asians (ABLIM1-rs7099208, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, and PEX10-rs2477686) with different manifestations of SpF in Iberians of European descent, likely by influencing gene expression and lincRNA deregulation."

Reliable detection of CNVs from genome sequencing data has been a strong demand for disease research. However, current software for detecting CNVs has high false-positive rates, which needs further improvement. Methods Here, we proposed a novel and post-processing approach for CNVs prediction (CNV-P), a machine-learning framework that could efficiently remove false-positive fragments from results of CNVs detecting tools. A series of CNVs signals such as read depth (RD), split reads (SR) and read pair (RP) around the putative CNV fragments were defined as features to train a classifier. Results The prediction results on several real biological datasets showed that our models could accurately classify the CNVs at over 90% precision rate and 85% recall rate, which greatly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our results indicate that CNV-P is robust to different sizes of CNVs and the platforms of sequencing. Conclusions Our framework for classifying high-confident CNVs could improve both basic research and clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases."

The putative functions of the positive SNPs were determined using online bioinformatics tools. Results After adjusting for gender, age, high-risk population, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), IL28B-rs12979860 and rs8099917 genotypes, the non-conditional logistic regression showed that rs7514229-T, rs3181366-T, and rs2295800-C were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection (all P FDR < 0.05). Combined analysis of rs7514229-T and rs3181366-T risk alleles showed that the subjects carrying 2-4 risk alleles were more susceptible to HCV infection compared with those lacking any risk allele (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk of HCV infection increased with the number of risk alleles (P trend < 0.001). In silico analysis showed that rs7514229, rs3181366, and rs2295800 polymorphisms may affect the transcription of mRNA by regulating miRNA binding, TF binding, and promoter activation, respectively, which may have biological consequences.

https://openalex.org/W3167670337,"Abstract  Novel pathogens evolve quickly and may emerge rapidly, causing dangerous outbreaks or even global pandemics. Next-generation sequencing is the state-of-the-art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens, but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Incomplete sequences contain less information, leading to a trade-off between sequencing time and detection accuracy. Using a workflow for real-time pathogenic potential prediction, we investigate which subsequences already allow accurate inference. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate the models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. This approach outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we observe an 80-fold sensitivity increase compared to real-time mapping. The first 250bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. The approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats."

We found that imputed HLA-DQA1*05:01, DQB1*0201 and DRB1*0301 were associated with SLE; HLA-DQA1*03:03, DQB1*0401, DRB1*0405 were more frequently observed in patients with RA.We established ML methods for genomic prediction of RA and SLE. Genetic variations at HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 were crucial for differentiating RA from SLE. Future studies are required to verify our results and explore their mechanistic explanation."

Accurate identification of new AFPs is important in understanding ice-protein interactions and creating novel ice-binding domains in other proteins. In this paper, an accurate method, called AFP_PSSM, has been developed for predicting antifreeze proteins using a support vector machine (SVM) and position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in the form of PSSM profiles has been successfully used for predicting antifreeze proteins. Tested by 10-fold cross validation and independent test, the accuracy of the proposed method reaches 82.67% for the training dataset and 93.01% for the testing dataset, respectively. These results indicate that our predictor is a useful tool for predicting antifreeze proteins. A web server (AFP_PSSM) that implements the proposed predictor is freely available."
https://openalex.org/W2796657347,"Transcription factors bind complex regulatory DNA sequence patterns in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn these cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order, epistatic feature interactions encoded by the models. We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics."

In the present study, the association between CYP1A1 gene polymorphisms (IVS1-728G > A, Thr461Asn and Ile462Val), and the risk of oral cancer, was examined among 157 patients with oral cancer and 132 age-matched controls, in a south Indian population. The strength of the association between CYP1A1 variants and oral cancer was estimated by logistic regression. It was found that Thr461Asn was not polymorphic. Both IVS1-728G > A and Ile462Val frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There were no significant differences in genotype or haplotype frequencies between controls and cases with oral cancer.

It is assumed that the core motifs of a transcription factor protein exists in all data subsets. We employed seven motif prediction tools to obtain initial candidate motifs and they are merged according to their sequence content similarity. An alignment-free method is used to establish motif similarity. A novel motifs merging method is proposed to merge similar motifs obtained by tools in different data partitions. Ten genome-wide ChIP datasets are collected for evaluation.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in the development of AS has few been investigated in Chinese population.  Methods  A total of 362 patients with AS and 362 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Five SNPs in MMP3 genotypes were identified by Agena MassARRAY. Chi-squared tests and genetic model were used to evaluate associations.  Results  rs522616 had a significant risk of AS development compared to those with the TT genotype (p = 0.008). By multiple logistic regression models analysis, in codominant model, rs522616 CT genotypes also had a 1.44-fold risk (95% CI = 1.06-1.96, p = 0.008) for AS development compared to those with TT genotypes. In recessive model, the CC genotypes was a significantly reduced AS risk for individuals with TT/CT genotype (OR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.41-0.99, p = 0.040).

https://openalex.org/W2885432890,"The genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) aims to identify the most influential markers in relation to the phenotype values. One of the substantial challenges is to find a non-linear mapping between genotype and phenotype, also known as epistasis, that usually becomes the process of searching and identifying functional SNPs more complex. Some diseases such as cervical cancer, leukemia and type 2 diabetes have low heritability. The heritability of the sample is directly related to the explanation defined by the genotype, so the lower the heritability the greater the influence of the environmental factors and the less the genotypic explanation. In this work, an algorithm capable of identifying epistatic associations at different levels of heritability is proposed. The developing model is a aplication of genetic programming with a specialized initialization for the initial population consisting of a random forest strategy. The initialization process aims to rank the most important SNPs increasing the probability of their insertion in the initial population of the genetic programming model. The expected behavior of the presented model for the obtainment of the causal markers intends to be robust in relation to the heritability level. The simulated experiments are case-control type with heritability level of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 considering scenarios with 100 and 1000 markers. Our approach was compared with the GPAS software and a genetic programming algorithm without the initialization step.

https://openalex.org/W3206753235,"Genomic prediction has been widely used in multiple areas and various genomic prediction methods have been developed. The majority of these methods, however, focus on statistical properties and ignore the abundant useful biological information like genome annotation or previously discovered causal variants. Therefore, to improve prediction performance, several methods have been developed to incorporate biological information into genomic prediction, mostly in single-trait analysis. A commonly used method to incorporate biological information is allocating molecular markers into different classes based on the biological information and assigning separate priors to molecular markers in different classes. It has been shown that such methods can achieve higher prediction accuracy than conventional methods in some circumstances. However, these methods mainly focus on single-trait analysis, and available priors of these methods are limited. Thus, in both single-trait and multiple-trait analysis, we propose the multi-class Bayesian Alphabet methods, in which multiple Bayesian Alphabet priors, including RR-BLUP, BayesA, BayesB, BayesCΠ, and Bayesian LASSO, can be used for markers allocated to different classes. The superior performance of the multi-class Bayesian Alphabet in genomic prediction is demonstrated using both real and simulated data.

In the present study, we investigated whether LINC00299 methylation is associated with TNBC in a prospective nested breast cancer case–control study within the Generations Study.

To assess the association between methylation level and TNBC risk, logistic regression was used to calculate odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for smoking status. We found no evidence for association between methylation levels and TNBC overall (P = 0.062). Subgroup analysis according to age at diagnosis and age at blood draw revealed increased methylation levels in TNBC cases compared with controls in the young age groups [age 26–52 (P = 0.0025) and age 22–46 (P = 0.001), respectively].

https://openalex.org/W3135491122,"To uncover the genetic underpinnings of brain disorders, brain imaging genomics usually jointly analyzes genetic variations and imaging measurements. Meanwhile, other biomarkers such as proteomic expressions can also carry valuable complementary information. Therefore, it is necessary yet challenging to investigate the underlying relationships among genetic variations, proteomic expressions, and neuroimaging measurements, which stands a chance of gaining new insights into the pathogenesis of brain disorders. Given multiple types of biomarkers, using sparse multi-view canonical correlation analysis (SMCCA) and its variants to identify the multi-way associations is straightforward. However, due to the gradient domination issue caused by the naive fusion of multiple SCCA objectives, SMCCA is suboptimal. In this paper, we proposed two adaptive SMCCA (AdaSMCCA) methods, i.e. the robustness-aware AdaSMCCA and the uncertainty-aware AdaSMCCA, to analyze the complicated associations among genetic, proteomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers. We also imposed a data-driven feature grouping penalty to the genetic data with aim to uncover the joint inheritance of neighboring genetic variations. An efficient optimization algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge, was provided. Using two state-of-the-art SMCCA as benchmarks, we evaluated robustness-aware AdaSMCCA and uncertainty-aware AdaSMCCA on both synthetic data and real neuroimaging, proteomics, and genetic data. Both proposed methods obtained higher associations and cleaner canonical weight profiles than comparison methods, indicating their promising capability for association identification and feature selection. In addition, the subsequent analysis showed that the identified biomarkers were related to Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating the power of our methods in identifying multi-way bi-multivariate associations among multiple heterogeneous biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2016776747,"Most current methods for estimating gene/isoform expression levels from high-throughput whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data rely on mapping the reads to a reference genome and/or transcriptome and do not consider the difference between the two parental alleles (diploid transcriptome). The diploid transcriptome can be easily inferred when a diploid genome is available, as in recent studies of cis- and trans-regulation [8] and parent-of-origin effects [5] that use hybrids of inbred species or strains. However, reconstructing the diploid genome of human subjects remains a difficult task [3]. Hence, existing studies of allele-specific gene expression rely on simple alleles coverage analysis for heterozygous Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) sites within transcripts. Such approaches typically do not allow inference of allele-specific expression of individual gene isoforms, result in less robust estimates since they use only RNA-Seq reads that overlap heterozygous SNP sites, and are affected by systematic read mapping biases toward reference alleles [1][6]."

Although several cancer susceptibility RAD52 single nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs) have been identified previously, little was known on how the RAD52 SNPs are involved in glioma development in Han Chinese. Therefore, we examined the association between five RAD52 SNPs (rs1051669, rs10774474, rs11571378, rs7963551 and rs6489769) and glioma risk using a case-control design. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. We found that only the RAD52 rs7963551 SNP was significantly associated with glioma risk, with the odds of having the rs7963551 AC or CC genotype in patients was 0.49 (95 % CI 0.37-0.65, P = 9.2 9 10 -6 ) or 0.39 (95 % CI 0.18-0.81, P = 0.012) compared with the AA genotype. These data are consistent with functional relevance of allelic regulation of RAD52 expression by the rs7963551 SNP and miRNA let-7 in cancer cells.

Finally, based on the previous version's framework, KOBAS increased the number of supported species from 1327 to 5944. For an easier local run, it also provides a prebuilt Docker image that requires no installation, as a supplementary to the source code version. KOBAS can be freely accessed at http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn, and a mirror site is available at http://bioinfo.org/kobas."

Methods The study sample consisted of 906 female (including 474 patients with AD and 432 controls) and 406 male (such as 226 patients with AD and 180 controls) participants. Genotyping of ten polymorphisms of the FLG gene was done. The logistic regression was used to analyze the associations. A total of 125 SNPs (seven AD-associated SNPs and 118 proxy SNPs, r 2 ≥0.8) FLG gene were used for the in silico functional annotation analysis in the females. Results Significant associations were identified between seven SNPs of the FLG gene (rs12130219, rs61816761, rs558269137, rs12144049, rs3126085, rs471144, rs6661961) and AD in females: rs12144049 was associated independent individually (for allele C OR = 1.71, 95%Сl 1.19–2.46, р perm = 0.004 and OR = 1.76, 95%Сl 1.18–2.63, р perm = 0.006 according to the additive and dominant genetic models, respectively) and seven SNPs of the FLG gene within 14 haplotypes. Haplotype GGT [rs61816761-rs3126085-rs12144049] showed the strongest association (OR = 0.55, р perm = 0.001). No association between the analyzed SNPs and AD was determined in the male group. The subsequent bioinformatic analysis predicted the SNPs of the FLG gene that possessed epigenetic and non-synonymous effects, were involved in the control of gene expression and alternative splicing of genes that contribute to AD pathophysiology. Conclusion Polymorphisms of the FLG gene are associated with AD in females but not in males in the Caucasian population of Central Russia."
