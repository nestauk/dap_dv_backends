The company currently has two areas of therapeutic focus:  1. Ulcerative Colitis (UC) A first-in-class oral therapeutic targeting a cause of this disease. A companion diagnostic profiles patients for prospective treatment, ensuring increased responsiveness and better outcomes. There is no cure for UC and significant unmet needs in the treatment of UC. a substantial percentage of patients who respond to a therapy will lose this response over time. More than 40% of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis do not reach remission with current available therapies. The current standard of care is to treat the symptoms. Precidiag's approach offers to change the paradigm in the treatment of UC - addressing a cause of the disease. 2. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) The World health organization estimates that there are 70 million people with a diagnosis of ASD. Growing insidence rates have been observed around the world. In the US 1 in 54 children will be diagnosed with ASD. In South Korea the rate is 1 in 38 children. There are acute unmet needs in this area. ASD is a behavioral diagnosis and therefore cannot be diagnosed utilizing a medical test. There are no approved therapeutics to address the core symptoms of ASD. Precidiag has, in concert with Massachusetts General Hospital, launched the largest study in the world to study the associations of gut microbiota to the symptoms experienced by individuals with ASD.

Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases. With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Day Zero delivers a complete diagnosis, including both the species and antibiotic resistance profile, in hours vs. days, enabling the physician to use a targeted treatment on day zero of hospital admission and resulting in better patient outcomes and cost savings."

We believe the potential of biomedical and multi-omic data is maximized when it is accessible, interactive, and shareable. Extracting meaningful insights from pools of data takes a truly interoperable ecosystem that breaks down silos of complex information and sparks collaboration. The ROSALIND platform harnesses the power of scientific collaboration, cloud computing, and data science to enable integrated analyses that unify knowledge through an intuitive user interface that is built for any researcher.
