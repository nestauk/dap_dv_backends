Changing global patterns of food consumption and related consumer expectations are putting enormous strain on the sustainability of food production and natural resources. Further pressures will derive from the world's population increasing by a third and reaching almost 10 billion over the next 30 years. By 2050 the U.N. estimates that global agricultural production will need to increase by about 70%. Supply won't meet demand. Not without a more holistic approach to improve yields, soil and nutrient efficiency and reduce waste.  Food production cycles must be improved at every stage and for any solution to have a positive and lasting impact, on a large scale, it must be commercially viable.  Their work is to help meet this challenge.  Through the activities of over 2,500 people across 34 countries and the development of innovative technologies, they aim to contribute enduring solutions to improve efficiency in the production of healthy and nutritious food to meet the food requirements borne out of the increasing demands of changing global population. Their purpose is to deliver lasting commercial and social benefit, using their expertise with a far-sighted perspective. They apply rigorous financial discipline to their activities in order to achieve long term commercial success. But they do so with the aim of making a positive and lasting impact on society by developing and investing in solutions they believe will make a material difference in meeting one of the defining challenges of their time — the provision of enough food to meet the demands of a changing global population, in a way which benefits people's health and wellbeing and nature.",
